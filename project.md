Need to assemble a Docker solution for a Nexus OSS 3 Repo

Need this to a Centos 7 server hosting the Image that is a Centos 7 Image running Nexus
Need this to be a scripted solution that will go up / destroyed / restored when coming back up?

These are the links that will help; please let me know what questions you have?

I already have some Dockerfiles and can get most of this already; just need a "good person" that can help me get this going? Need to have so a script I can call from "someplace like jenkins" and be ready to go from last time it ran?

What am I missing ?
